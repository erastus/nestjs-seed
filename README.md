## Description

**nestjs-seed** is a base project designed to accelerate the development of applications with <a href="https://nestjs.com" target="_blank">**NestJS**</a>, providing an organized initial structure, built-in best practices, and production-ready configurations. Its purpose is to serve as a starting point for building modular, scalable, and maintainable applications in **TypeScript/JavaScript**, reducing setup time and avoiding the repetition of common configuration tasks.


üå± **Preconfigured initial architecture** based on principles of modularity and separation of concerns.  

‚ö° **Improved productivity**, with utilities, examples, and ready-to-use patterns.  

üõ°Ô∏è **Built-in best practices**, following quality, security, and maintainability standards.  

üèóÔ∏è **Scalability**, designed for both small projects and large enterprise solutions.  

üîÑ **Flexibility**, allowing you to adapt, extend, or replace modules according to your project's needs.  

---

With **nestjs-seed**, you can focus directly on business logic without worrying about initial setup, while having a solid foundation that can evolve into a custom framework or grow alongside your enterprise application.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Using as a Template (for new projects)

If you want to start a new project using this seed:

1. Clone the repository (or use **Use this template**):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/erastus/nestjs-seed my-app
   cd my-app
   ```

2. **Optional**: remove the `src/system/` folder if you don‚Äôt plan to collaborate on the package:
   ```bash
   rm -rf src/system
   ```

3. **If you removed** `src/system/` **in the previous step**, install the package from npm:
   ```bash
   npm install nestjs-seed@latest
   ```

4. **If you performed step 2 and 3**, configure your `tsconfig.json` to include the `node_modules/nestjs-seed` path.  
   Example:
   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "paths": {
         "system/*": ["../node_modules/nestjs-seed/build/system/*"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **If you performed step 2 and 3**, configure your `jest-e2e.json` to include the `node_modules/nestjs-seed` path.  
   Example:
   ```json
   {
     "moduleNameMapper": {
      "^@system/(.*)$": "<rootDir>/node_modules/nestjs-seed/build/system/$1"
    }
   }
   ```

6. Start coding your application

## Lint / Code Quality

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Build / Compile

```bash
# build the project for production
npm run build
```

## Run / Start the project

```bash

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
